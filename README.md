Application of Bayesian Deep Neural Networks for Depression Recognition and Comparison Analysis with Artificial Neural Network, Based On Facial Expressions


Data Source: iMotion has collected data with facial recognition system which is called activia and shared for analysis.
iMotions Programmer’s Guide: iMotions right now upholds various sensors for estimating a respondent's state during a test for example Emotiv EEG, Affectiva QSensor. Anyway there are a lot more sensor gadgets that a client could use, and it is unfeasible for iMotions to help each such gadget. Rather it is conceived that a third party application would be made that interfaces with their ideal gadget set, and afterward passes the information subsequently gathered to iMotions programming. This information will be treated similarly as information gathered from the sensors with worked in help for example it will be adjusted with any remaining gathered information, it very well may be envisioned on a diagram, will be put away in the data set and saved with the review, will be accessible in the text information trade for additional investigation and so on. This report depicts the strategy by which an outsider application can send caught sensor readings to iMotions programming. (Guide, iMotions Programmer’s, 2018)

We have done data mining to make the analysis focused on our goal
